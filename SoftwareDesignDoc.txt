1.Introduction:
The Localization class is designed to facilitate the localization of user interface components properties such as "Caption", "Text", "Items", "Lines", and "Hint" in a  application. It provides methods to read localization data from files, apply localized values to components, and handle language selection changes.

2.Class Details:
##Class Name:TMyPage
##Base Class:TForm(VCL framework)
##Header File:MyPage.h

###Public Members:
●Constructor: Reads localization data from files, and sets up event handlers.
●ComboBoxToSelectLangChange: Handles the change event of the language selection combo box.

###Private Members:
●LocalizeComponentCaptionAndText:     Localizes the "Caption" and "Text" properties of components based on selected language.
●LocalizeComponentItemsAndLines:      Localizes the "Items" and "Lines" properties of components based on selected language.
●LocalizeHint:                        Localizes the "Hint" property of components based on selected language.
●ReadTranslationData:                 Reads localization data from files and populates the corresponding data structures.
●fixNewline:                          Replaces"\\n" with actual newline characters ("\n") in a given string.

3.Conclusion:
The Localization provides a convenient and organized way to implement multi-language support for user interface components in a C++ Builder application. 
By centralizing localization logic, it simplifies the process of managing and applying localized data to various properties of components. 

Note:With the following design,localization can be performed only to the components of this classs since the localization functions are private.
In order to have access to other forms ,its recommended to create a global fucntion fo localization.
